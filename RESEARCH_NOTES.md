## Entry 1: Initial Setup and Architecture Analysis
**Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Focus**: Project foundation and documentation

### Key Discoveries
1. **Paper vs Implementation Gap**: The current implementation has all the structural components from the paper but uses mock data throughout
2. **Tool Architecture**: The 6-tool architecture matches the paper exactly - good foundation for research
3. **Iterative Approach**: The v0.4 execution method implements the paper's iterative refinement concept

### Worktree Strategy Implemented
Successfully created 4 parallel exploration tracks:
- `enhanced-mocks`: Focus on realistic mock implementations 
- `defensive-analysis`: Security analysis and vulnerability detection
- `educational-features`: Logging, tracing, and learning tools
- `paper-comparison`: Implementation closer to original methodology

### Next Research Questions
1. How can we make the mock implementations more realistic for educational purposes?
2. What defensive security patterns can we extract from the tool coordination approach?
3. How does the iterative LLM-guided approach compare to traditional static analysis?
