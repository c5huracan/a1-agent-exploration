Given a description of a smart contract and its intended use, recommend the most appropriate security analysis tool(s) for identifying potential vulnerabilities.  Justify your selection based on the contract's specific characteristics and the strengths of the recommended tool(s).  Consider factors like the contract's complexity, the types of vulnerabilities it might be susceptible to, and the tool's ability to detect those vulnerabilities efficiently and accurately.  Prioritize tools that provide comprehensive analyses and actionable insights.  If multiple tools are appropriate, rank them by priority and explain the rationale for the ranking.",
